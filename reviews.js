        review: `So grateful for the service we received from Cooper's Floors. 
        We wanted to update all the flooring in our office, but only had a small time window 
        to get it all done. They made it happen! From selecting the exact right carpet for 
        our space through the installation, they made the whole process very easy. 
        And the final product looks amazing! We've received SO many complements on the new 
        carpet.`

        review: `We purchased carpeting for our home through Cooperâ€™s Floors 
        & could not be happier!  Everyone was helpful & knowledgeable in guiding us 
        through what all of our options were.  We were educated on what styles 
        would work best in our space given the amount of wear & tear it would have.  
        They were able to work within our budget ensuring we received the best quality 
        carpet we could get for our price range.  Their pricing is reasonable & 
        up front, with no hidden costs or surprises like other places.  
        Plus, we were happy to be supporting a local small business.  
        We will continue to utilize them for all of our future flooring needs!`

        review: `A couple years back I purchased flooring for my entire home during a 
        new construction build and was very pleased with the service I received from Cooper's
         Floors. They were very customer focused and tentative to my needs.  
         They helped guide me through the decision process in selecting the flooring 
         that would be best for my home and family.  
         I am so thankful for their advice as I was going to select a flooring
        that was not pet friendly, and as a pet owner of 2 dogs that would
        have been a big mistake.  I loved the advice I received and am very 
        very happy with the end result.  I continue to receive numerous compliments 
        on my flooring when people stop by.`

        review: `I recently purchased carpet and laminate through Coopers' Floors 
        and I could not be more happy with my experience. The staff was very 
        knowledgeable and the prices were competitive. Not only do I love my 
        floors and the experience, but I love that they are family owned and 
        operated. I will definitely be going to them for my basement carpet in 
        the future.`
